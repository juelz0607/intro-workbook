! is usually interpreted as declaring a statement, where as ? is asking a question
or "checking" a value in reflection to a boolean return. If used at the
end of a method, then ! or ? is part of that methods name. 

1. != means "not equal" and can be used as a comparator under the "if"
    method. 

2. Placing ! before a value returns a true value as false, or vice versa.

3. Placing ! after a method name usually indicates that the method 
    used will mutate the caller. 
    
4. Placing ? before a value can be used as a replacement for the "if"
    statement. 
    
5. Placing ? after a method checks the value that the method was called 
    upon and returns a boolean value, or the true data. 
    
6. Placing !! before a value turns any object into its boolean equivalent.
