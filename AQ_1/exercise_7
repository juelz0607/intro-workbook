The result would be 42. This stems from the numerical process of 
the "recursive" string. i.e. 

    def add_eight(number)
        number + 8
    end

    number = 2

    how_deep = "number"
    5.times { how_deep.gsub!("number", "add_eight(number)") }
    
simply means this: how_deep holds the value of "number" as a string. 
The method called upon how_deep repeats this value five times, while 
repalcing each instance of "number" (as a string) with "add_eight(number)"
also as a sting. When the eval method is called, it runs the "add_eight(number)"
method five times, resulting in 8*5+2.

At least that's my best guess!
